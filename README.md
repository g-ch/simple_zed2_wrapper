# Simple ZED2 WRAPPER

## Description
This is a ROS 1 wrapper used to realize object detection and human body tracking with the ZED2 camera. Official ROS 1 wrapper doesn't support human body tracking. But of course, we can also output depth image, localization data, point cloud etc.

## TODO
- Add launch file.
- Add vis message.
- Update readme.
